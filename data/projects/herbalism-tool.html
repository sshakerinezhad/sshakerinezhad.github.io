    A D&D character companion for the Elros Player's Guide - a 70-page expansion written by my buddy Nick that adds vocations, an elemental magic system, a martial combat overhaul, and more to 5E.

    This app is also a love letter to my friend Finn who hates everything about the EPG. Not becuase it ain't fun, but because it's "way too complicated"...
    Additionally, the herbalism system described in the EPG and implemented here is based on the work of AeronDrake & calculuschild so thanks to them as well.
  </p>


  <p>The System itself integrates all the existing homebrew modules from the EPG that include:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Vocations, special downtime roles that allow players to collect and utilize natural resources to make powerful items</li>
    <li>Inventory and equipment management for the overhauled armor and weapon systems</li>
    <li>EPG specific rules and mechanics</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    As of now the only fully implemented vocation is Herbalism which allows players to collect and combine plants to brew elexirs, bombs, and weapon oils.
  </p>

  <p>
    More is coming though, as I integrate the remaining vocations (Blacksmith, Alchemist, Priest, Runeseeker, Scholar, and Spellscribe) as well as the expanded martial combat rules and Archemancy elemental magic system which ties everything together.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall this is a very specific tool for a very specific game but if you're interested in trying it out for your own campaigns, it should be simple enough to plug in as is.
