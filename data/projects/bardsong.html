<div class="project-detail">
  <p><strong>Bardsong</strong> transforms your TTRPG session recordings into cinematic story recaps.</p>

  <p>Upload an audio recording of your session (or paste text notes), and Bardsong handles the rest: transcription, story extraction, scene generation, AI artwork, and assembly into a narrated visual recap—complete with music.</p>

  <h3>How It Works</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Input your session audio or notes</li>
    <li>AI transcribes and identifies key story beats</li>
    <li>Scenes are generated to capture the narrative arc</li>
    <li>Each scene gets a custom AI-generated illustration</li>
    <li>Everything stitches together with narration and music</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Why I Built This</h3>
  <p>Inspired by The Witcher 3's painted loading screen recaps. Campaigns are ephemeral—inside jokes fade, epic moments blur together. Bardsong preserves those stories so players have something to revisit between sessions and share with others.</p>

  <p><em>Status: Working prototype, currently in alpha testing.</em></p>
