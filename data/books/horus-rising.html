    <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
    <h2>First Impressions</h2>
    <p>The initial portions of the book are kind of dense. You do get bombarded with names, and places, and words that you have no context for and it can be a bit much. In Abnett's defence this is a consequence of the setting. He also handles it very well (and the dramatis personae section helps immensely).</p>
    <p>Personally I kind of like that style—the organic feeling of falling into this massive world and slowly picking up context from scattered clues.</p>

    <h2>The Characters</h2>
    <p>The characters are exceptional. Horus is like, a cool guy. You can't help but root for him. They are, extremely heavy handed with the foreshadowing though…</p>

    <img src="" alt="horus heresy title">

    <p>Hmmmm.</p>

    <p>I absolutely love the human characters. There's so much personality to them and the way you meet them really gives you an appreciation for how <em>nothing</em> they seem beside Astartes. But at the same time they MATTER.</p>

    <h2>The Protagonist</h2>
    <p>Ok, now let's talk about the <strong>protagonist</strong>.</p>
    <p>Yes Mr. Loken, whatever you say Mr. Loken sir.</p>
    <p>Fr this guy is a giga chad. Abnett essentially made an infallible character. But somehow in a very human way? Which is odd because he's specifically transhuman. There's this deep set pride and righteousness but instead of embracing it fully he wars with it like it's an attack dog that has its uses but NEEDS to be tamed.</p>

    <h2>The Mournival</h2>
    <p>The rest of the Mournival too. Man the whole initiation. First off so fitting that the book starts with the death of the advisor Loken replaces. Almost feels like THAT is the spark that lights everything. Not sure how yet but I'll revisit it.</p>

    <p>But back to the initiation. It's so strange how they're ritualizing everything, and Loken feels something's off.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Loken:</strong> "Like hey, what happened to humanistic atheism guys? Remember what the Emperor said about, I d'know, casting down your idols and trusting in the light of reason or whatever?"</p>
        <p><strong>Aximand:</strong> "Erm, akchually, it's a secular ritual."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Something here smells.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Anyway yeah that's what I'm focused on. All these subtle things that Loken keeps seeing and saying, <em>wait, that's not right.</em></p>
    <p>But then he gets one look at Luna Daddy or hangs out with the three stooges and everything's chill again.</p>
    <p>Anyway, I'm sure it's nothing to worry about…</p>
