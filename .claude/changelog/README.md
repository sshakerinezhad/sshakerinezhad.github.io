# Changelog

Archive of completed masterplans with full context.

## Purpose

This folder preserves the history of past projects and their learnings. When starting new work, check here for relevant past decisions that might inform your approach.

## Naming Convention

Files follow the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md`

Example: `2026-01-15-mobile-responsive-layout.md`

## Creating Archives

Use `/archive-plan` when a masterplan is complete. This command:
1. Copies the masterplan here verbatim
2. Proposes CLAUDE.md updates based on learnings
3. Resets masterplan.md and workplan.md for the next project
