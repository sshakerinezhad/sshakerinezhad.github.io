# Session Handoff - 2026-01-16

## What Was Done
- Reviewed project brief in `win95_website_brief_v2.md`
- Researched Win95 UI libraries and implementation patterns
- Created comprehensive implementation plan
- Plan saved to `.claude/masterplan.md`

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Tech stack**: Plain HTML/CSS/JS (not Next.js) for simpler GitHub Pages deployment
2. **Libraries**: 98.css (styling) + WinBox.js (window management)
3. **Default windows**: About + Research & Projects open on load
4. **Mobile**: Keep Win95 aesthetic, windows stack vertically, no dragging
5. **Sounds**: Optional, muted by default, user can enable
6. **No emojis**: Use retro pixel icons (.ico files) instead

## Current State
- Fresh repo with no code yet
- Full plan documented in masterplan.md
- Ready to start Phase 1: Foundation

## Next Steps (Phase 1)
1. Create `index.html` with 98.css + WinBox.js CDN links
2. Set up desktop container and basic styling
3. Get a single test window working
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages to verify
