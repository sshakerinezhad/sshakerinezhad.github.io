      Deep beneath the earth, ancient magic stirs. Through a portal of gravity-defying water, the party leaves the safety of the Thallichuria for whatever awaits them in Engelschloss.

  The project started when I got an idea from watching the loading screen still in <href link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">The Witcher 3</a>.
    I thought about how cool it could be if every single one of my D&D sessions could be immortalized in the same way.
</p>

  <p>The process is actually pretty simple:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Input your session audio or notes</li>
    <li>We transcribe the session and pick out key moments into <strong>scenes</strong></li>
    <li>Each scene is then run through an image model to generate a illustration of that scene in fantastic detail</li>
    <li>Each image gets stitched together with music, narration, and a sprinkle of parallax</li>
  </ol>

        Heavy is the head that wears the crown, and heavier still is the price of power. King Cyril pays the toll in blood and sight, sacrificing everything for the chance to save his kingdom.

    This project is very near and dear to my heart because I've played D&D for so many years, and the ability to bring these stories that exist in the memories and imaginations of my closest friends to life in such a striking way is priceles...
